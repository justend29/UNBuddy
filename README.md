# UNBuddy

UNBuddy is a prototype of a course dependency manager and was created as the term project of TME3313.
Its purpose is to:
1. Illustrate course dependencies and program requirements to students and automatically determine if a course selection fulfils a given students needs at the moment it's selected.
2. Compile the various lists of course options, such as eligable basic science electives, technical electives, and complementary study electives, into a single location.
3. Provide students with an automatic system to validate their dependencies are being met.

The repository contains all implementation details and code related to the UNBuddy prototype for TME3313.
